The south Brazil is an important feeding area for sea turtles. Previous work reported high incidence of strandings and incidental capture of Caretta caretta in this region. ARGOS-linked Wildlife Computers PTTs, SPLASH models, were attached to 5 juveniles and 4 adults of loggerhead turtles (mean Curved Carapace Length=77.1 cm, sd=13.2), catched by bottom pair trawlers on Rio Grande do Sul continental shelf. The deployment date range from Dec/2014 to Apr/2015 and 5 turtles were transmitting until Oct/2015. Sea surface temperature (SST) (http://ghrsst-pp.metoffice.com/) and bathymetric data (www.gebco.net) were integrated for physical analyses influencing the turtles movements.  Bathymetric data were used to classify the positions into 4 groups: Inner Continental Shelf (depth<50 m), Outer Continental Shelf (50-200 m), Continental Slope and Rise (200-1000 m) and Abyssal Plain (>1000 m). The number of transmitting days ranged from 58 to 240 (mean=168 days, sd=71.4). The individual number of dive histograms registered in a day ranged from 1.2 to 5.8 (mean=2.3 histograms/day). The transmitted positions go from north of Argentina (42º S) to Paraná State (25º S), with a maximum coastline distance of ~1500 km (36º W). Most of the positions were located at the abyssal plain (42%), followed by the Inner Shelf (37%) and Outer Shelf (19%). All turtles have registered most Time-At-Depth (TAD) in shallow dives (<25 m), varying from 55 to 98% of individual time in this class. They spent approximately 15% of total time at depths greater than 50 m, with exception of two turtles that spent more than 25% of it. A 200 m depth dive was registered for one individual and deeper than 100 m for 5 other turtles. In general, the turtles spent more time in deep dives when they were located at Outer Shelf when compared with the Slope and Abyssal Plain, indicating that these individuals seek for food near the seabed on the continental shelf, as described by the literature. 

 

The minimum SST recorded was 15 ºC, as well as the minimum recorded by the tags, to the same turtle and season. The turtles stayed in south (bellow 30º S) during the winter, instead 3 of them have moved away from coast to warmer waters. Temperatures below 17 °C were recorded mainly in the inner shelf. 

 

Two turtles presented dives with higher duration on areas with colder water, what suggest a  decrease in metabolism and consequently increase the ability to support long periods submerged, as described by literature. 

 

All turtles recorded dive duration greater than 60 minutes and this class of duration was representative (> 20% of dives) for 6 turtles. The results presented here are very important and help a better understanding the loggerhead behavior in foraging area. Also, these data can be used  as support in defining priority areas for conservation and helping to reduce the incidental capture in fisheries.
